# ImpressionistPainters
## Overview
An app that lets you take any photo and create a unique impressionist copy of your own design.
## Features
- Various brushes including Circle, Square, Line, Circle Splatter, and Line Splatter
- Incorporates facial recognition to automatically reduce the size of the brush to pick fine details in a face.
- Use the facial radial and facial ring brushes to orbit the closest person's face.

## Potential Features
- [ ] Animated art. What if each point you drew vibrated or oscillated slightly so it looked like your art was alive?
- [ ] Make the fine tuning for the brush size scale. If the diminished brush size was constant, pictures where a person's face takes up the whole screen would take forever to fill in.
- [ ] Make sure facial radial and facial ring don't work if no faces are in the image.

## How to Run
- Open up the app
- Hit "Load Image" to pick a base image. If you don't have any, you can hit "Download Images" to download some sample images.
- With the image running, hit the "Brush" button and select your brush.
- If you don't like your drawing, hit "Clear"
- Draw on the canvas to the right and enjoy!
